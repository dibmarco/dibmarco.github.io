            <h3>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu History</h3>
            <p>Mitsuyo Maeda, one of the Kodokan's top groundwork experts trained by Tomita Tsunejir≈ç, the first student of judo's
            founder Kano Jigoro, was sent overseas to demonstrate and spread his art to the world. He left Japan in 1904 and visited
            several countries giving "jiu-do" demonstrations and accepting challenges from wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters, and
            various other martial artists, and arrived in Brazil on 14 November 1914.</p>
